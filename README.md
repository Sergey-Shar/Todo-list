## Simple-todo-list 

### About the project:
In this project, I used a functional approach and divided it into modules.  To save data from the user, I used the web storage API, after reloading the page, all cases are saved.  This project was implemented in javascript, the HTML file has only the root element. To work with styles, I used the tailwind css library.
